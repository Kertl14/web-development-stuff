        The first step in understanding how to 
        position elements is to understand the fundamental model of CSS—the box model.
    </p>

    <h2>The Box Model</h2>

    <p>
        Every element you place on a page creates a box. You cannot always see the boundaries and the 
        borders of the boxes you create, but the boxes are there. A <em>div</em> element creates a box, as do <em>h1</em>,<em>img</em>, 
        <em>span</em>, and <em>td</em> elements. Each box has properties you can set with CSS. I’ve illustrated some of these 
        properties in Figure 1.

    <strong>Figure 1 Border, padding, and margin</strong>
    </p>


    <p>
        The <em>padding</em> of a box is the distance between the content of the box and the box’s border, 
        and the <em>margin</em> is the distance between a box and any adjacent element. In other words, padding 
        adds space inside the border, while a margin adds space outside the border. In the following CSS, I set 
        both the padding and the margin to a distance of 10 pixels. This is why you can see so much white space 
        in Figure 1.
    </p>

    <p>
        The border surrounding every element is not visible by default, but by using CSS I can change the color 
        of an element’s border, as well as the thickness and line style the browser uses when drawing the border. 
        What you see in Figure 1 is the result of a style rule telling the browser to draw a solid, thin, red line 
        around the box that each div element creates.
